              in Amsterdam, I worked on analyzing and optimizing investment
              portfolios using a combination of Excel and Python alongside the
              Bloomberg API. My primary focus was to evaluate the risk and
              performance of a specific portfolio, identifying its strengths and
              weaknesses. By leveraging advanced tools and methodologies, I
              contributed to a restructuring of the portfolio to make it more
              forward-looking and to reduce its beta, aligning it with long-term
              strategic goals.
